  <p align="center">
    MR.CAP, or Multi-robot Joint Control and Planning for Object Transport, is a novel approach to solve simultaneous multi-robot control and planning problems. The algorithm is developed in C++, making use of factor graph inference and an innovative problem reduction to provide a robust, fast and scalable solution. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of optimization time, scalability and robustness. The algorithm is tested in simulation and on a real robot system. The paper was accepted for publication in IEEE Control Systems Letters. See the website for more information.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

MR.CAP, or Multi-robot Joint Control and Planning for Object Transport, is a novel approach to solve simultaneous multi-robot control and planning problems. The algorithm is developed in C++, making use of factor graph inference and an innovative problem reduction to provide a robust, fast and scalable solution. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of optimization time, scalability and robustness. The algorithm is tested in simulation and on a real robot system. The paper was accepted for publication in IEEE Control Systems Letters. See the website for more information.

This repository serves to provide the robotics community for a platform to test and develop the algorithm further, as well as to provide a platform for future research in the field of multi-robot control and planning. Our code is released as open source under the MIT license. We hope that this will help to accelerate the development of multi-robot systems and to provide a platform for future research in the field of multi-robot control and planning.

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/h2jaafar/mr.cap.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
